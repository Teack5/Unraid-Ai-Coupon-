### **3. Automated Media Organization (Plex, Jellyfin, etc.)**  
For media server users, AI can:  
- **Auto-tag and categorize movies/TV shows** using metadata.  
- **Improve subtitle matching** with natural language processing (NLP).  
- **Optimize transcoding settings** based on device usage.  

### **4. Predictive Hardware Failures**  
AI can monitor drive health (SMART data) and:  
- **Predict drive failures before they happen.**  
- **Recommend replacements** based on usage trends.  

## **How to Implement AI in Unraid Today**  
While Unraid doesnâ€™t have native AI features, you can integrate AI-powered tools via:  
- **Docker Containers:** Run AI-based apps like:  
  - **Tdarr** (AI-powered media transcoding).  
  - **PhotoPrism** (AI photo organization).  
  - **Nextcloud + AI plugins** (smart file tagging).  
- **Community Plugins:** Some Unraid plugins use ML for analytics.  
- **Custom Scripts:** Python-based AI models for predictive storage.  

## **The Future of Unraid AI**
